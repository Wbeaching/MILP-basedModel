MILP-based Differential Attack on Round-Reduced GIFT
d.py is the source code used in Section 4, we use it to gain a 12-round differential characteristic with probability 2^{-59} and eight 4-round iterative differential characteristic.
difchar128.py is the source code used in Section 5, we use it to gain some differential characteristic with high probability, and we found a 18-round differential characteristic with probability 2^{-109}
